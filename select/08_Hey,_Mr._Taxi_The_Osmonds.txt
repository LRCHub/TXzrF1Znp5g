Hey Mr. Taxi, please make it snappy
Got so many things to do yeah
Mercy, crazy driver how did I get stuck with you

Sure would be happy if you slow down your taxi
Think you got a heavy shoe, yeah
Mercy, take it easy, taxi man I'm talking to you, yeah

Hey, Mr. Taxi, I think you've gone wacky
Wanna walk the rest of the way, yeah
Help me, someone help me, he doesn't hear I thing I say, yeah

Let me out, let me out, get me out of here
Lеt me out, let me out, gеt me out of here
Let me out, let me out, get me out of here
